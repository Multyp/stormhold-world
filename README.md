# STORMHOLD World

Welcome to the repository for STORMHOLD, a fantasy world of my own creation. This project is a web-based exploration of STORMHOLD, designed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It aims to present the rich and diverse settings of this imaginary continent, providing an engaging experience for visitors.

## Project Overview

This site showcases the continent of STORMHOLD, divided into united kingdoms with diverse terrains such as mountains, forests, and various kingdoms. Each area has its unique characteristics and role within the larger world.

### Major Locations

- **GOLDENHALL**: The capital city and political hub of the continent.
- **DAWNFALL**: A dwarven kingdom known for its great mines.
- **LARIOM**: A human kingdom famed for its strategic military and rich culture.
- **MIRLUN**: An elven kingdom celebrated for its ancient forests and mystical heritage.

### Economics

The kingdoms of STORMHOLD are interdependent, with a dynamic economy of exports and imports:

- **LARIOM** exports agricultural products and imports ores for manufacturing.
- **MIRLUN** exports crafts and medicines, importing technological goods and processed foods.

### Politics

Governed by an alliance known as THE GREAT ELDERS, STORMHOLD's political landscape features elections every four years and governance that respects local autonomies while adhering to continental laws.
