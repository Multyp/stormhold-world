        "With the gods retreating from the mortal world, the races of Stormhold were left to govern themselves. The Second Age began with the rise of the first great kingdoms: Mirlun, Lariom, Shubore, Dunewind, and Eryndor.",
        "These kingdoms were built on the ruins of the old world, with each race carving out its own territory and establishing its own systems of governance. This era was marked by both cooperation and conflict, as the various races vied for power and resources."

        "As the kingdoms of Stormhold grew in power, tensions began to rise. The first major conflict of the Second Age was the War of the North, a series of battles between Lariom and Shubore over control of the city of Ashenhelm. This war lasted for decades, with both sides gaining and losing ground in a brutal struggle for dominance.",
        "Another early conflict was the Sand War, a territorial dispute between Mirlun and Sundria over control of a fertile oasis. The sand-elves, masters of desert magic, fiercely defended their homeland, and the conflict ended in a stalemate."
